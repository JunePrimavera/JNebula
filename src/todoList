things I would like to get done


1. organize shader code: 15% complete

2. collisons: 30% complete

3. lighting. make more consistent: 10% complete

4. object editor: 16% complete (parser, interpter and the ability to generate )

5. Sprite renderering. make it less a default sprite: 0% compelete

6. animation suppport (make it not interfere with the code. thread.sleep does that): 45% complete

7. custom shaders. find a way to add them for people: Havent started.

8. documetation. look for an offical docs website: havent started
